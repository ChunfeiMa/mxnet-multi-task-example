# mxnet-multi-task-example
In this example, I will show you the method how to do muti-task(multi-label) training, after that I will show how to predict using saved model.
This tutorial based on mxnet examples under "/example/multi-task" folder, most of the code I use based on it, but I will try to make clear some questions I met during try such example.
